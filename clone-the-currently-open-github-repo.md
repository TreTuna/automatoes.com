# Clone the Currently Open Github Repo

Leveraging [[Get the Currently Open URL from Chrome]], we can use it as a variable and clone it. Using the `code` command for [[VS Code]] can also save yourself the steps of finding it on your computer to open it.

```bash
cd ~/projects
local url=$(chromeURL)

repo=${url:19}
name=${repo:t}

git clone git@github.com:$repo && code $name
```
