# Use Any Key as a Modifier

To use your `'` key as a modifier:

In your `karabiner.edn` file:

1. At the top-level, add a `simlayers` section and name a "mode" based on your `quote` key:

```clojure
:simlayers {;
             :quote-mode {:key :quote}
```

2. At the `:main` level, add a block based on `quote-mode`

```clojure
        {:des "quote mode"
         :rules [:quote-mode
                ; I use quote mode to trigger zsh functions
                 [:f [:zsh "thoughts"]]
                 [:c [:zsh "config"]]
                 [:z  [:zsh "zfunc"]]
                 ;
                 ]}
```
