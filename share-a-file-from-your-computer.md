# Share a File From Your Computer

Use `serve` to host the directory. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to tunnel into your computer. This generates a url like `wfuntawufo.ngrok.io` which you can share with a friend to download directly from your computer.

```bash
npx serve ./ & npx ngrok http 5000
```

> ⚠️ Make sure to Ctrl+C to close the processes once you've shared the file
